# MobileShopApp

Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS, MySql, AJAX, Hibernate, JSP, Servlets

This is my project which i did for the finals at IT Academy. It represents Web aplication for Mobile store.

Purpose of this project is to try to implement all thing that i've learned so far, and to make them functional. Of course, there is a lot things to do here, i want to improve and simplify it more. 
My next step for this app is to try to use Bootstrap to make it responsive to all size screens and to make design better, then to use Spring framework also, to simplify Jsp pages and make app more dinamic. I'am not happy with some things that i did, so i want to improve it and also to improve database.

There will be newer version soon.
